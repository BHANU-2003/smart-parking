## Smart Parking System

### Project Overview
This is a modern parking management system built with React and Java, featuring real-time spot management and automated billing.

### Key Features
1. **Dashboard**
   - Real-time view of available and occupied spots
   - Color-coded spot visualization (green for available, red for occupied)
   - Quick access to all system functions

2. **Spot Management**
   - 20 parking spots with real-time status updates
   - Visual representation of each spot's status
   - Detailed information for occupied spots

3. **Entry Management**
   - Vehicle registration with owner details
   - Automatic spot assignment
   - Time-based billing (₹100/hour)

4. **Revenue Tracking**
   - Daily revenue reports
   - Date-wise filtering
   - Total earnings calculation

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend (React)
- **Dashboard Component**: Central hub showing spot statistics
- **SpotFilter Component**: Manages spot filtering and detailed view
- **NewEntry Component**: Handles new vehicle registration
- **RevenueTracker**: Manages financial reporting

#### Backend (Java)
The `ParkingSpotManager.java` implements:
1. **Concurrent Processing**
   ```java
   private final ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
   private final ConcurrentHashMap<String, ParkingSpot> parkingSpots;
   ```
   - Handles multiple parking operations simultaneously
   - Prevents race conditions in spot allocation

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
   ```java
   @GetMapping("/calculate-bill/{recordId}")
   public ResponseEntity<BillingResponse> calculateBill()
   ```
   - Automatic bill calculation
   - Time-based rate application

3. **Thread Safety**
   ```java
   private final ReentrantLock reservationLock = new ReentrantLock();
   ```
   - Ensures atomic operations for spot reservation
   - Prevents double booking
